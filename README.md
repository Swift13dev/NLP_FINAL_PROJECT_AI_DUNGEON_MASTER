# NLP_FINAL_PROJECT_DRONETALK
DroneTalk is an NLP-based system that converts natural language commands into structured drone actions.
Users can give voice or text instructions like “Fly 50 meters north and take a picture”, and the model extracts the intent (fly, capture) and parameters (direction, distance, task) to generate a ready-to-execute command plan.
This project demonstrates intent classification, slot filling, and command generation for drone mission control.
